@article{Pascual-Marqui2007,
abstract = {This paper deals with the EEG/MEG neuroimaging problem: given measurements of scalp electric potential differences (EEG: electroencephalogram) and extracranial magnetic fields (MEG: magnetoencephalogram), find the 3D distribution of the generating electric neuronal activity. This problem has no unique solution. Only particular solutions with "good" localization properties are of interest, since neuroimaging is concerned with the localization of brain function. In this paper, a general family of linear imaging methods with exact, zero error localization to point-test sources is presented. One particular member of this family is sLORETA (standardized low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography; Pascual-Marqui, Methods Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol. 2002, 24D:5-12; http://www.unizh.ch/keyinst/NewLORETA/sLORETA/sLORETA-Math01.pdf). It is shown here that sLORETA has no localization bias in the presence of measurement and biological noise. Another member of this family, denoted as eLORETA (exact low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography; Pascual-Marqui 2005: http://www.research-projects.unizh.ch/p6990.htm), is a genuine inverse solution (not merely a linear imaging method) with exact, zero error localization in the presence of measurement and structured biological noise. The general family of imaging methods is further extended to include data-dependent (adaptive) quasi-linear imaging methods, also with the exact, zero error localization property.},

@article{Srinivasan1999,
abstract = {Given the complexity of neocortical source activity which largely determines observed EEG phenomena, it is of interest to categorize four types of sources. Whereas dipole localization methods are generally applicable only to one of these types, methods to improve spatial resolution apply to all four types of sources. The four types are: type I, localized and stationary, i.e., EEG due to a single dipole source that remains at fixed location over some time scale of interest in a particular application; type II, distributed and stationary, i.e., EEG sources form a dipole layer but important spatial characteristics remain relatively constant over the period of interest; type III, localized and nonstationary, i.e., EEG due to dipole source which move between a small number of well-defined locations; and type IV, distributed and nonstationary. Most EEG phenomena probably fit this last category, depending on accuracy required and length of time scale.{\textless}{\textless}ETX{\textgreater}{\textgreater}},

@article{Chung2014,
abstract = {In this work we consider the problem of finding optimal regularization parameters for general-form Tikhonov regularization using training data. We formulate the general-form Tikhonov solution as a spectral filtered solution using the generalized singular value decomposition of the matrix of the forward model and a given regularization matrix. Then, we find the optimal regularization parameter by minimizing the average of the errors between the filtered solutions and the true data. We extend the approach to the multi-parameter Tikhonov problem for the case where all the matrices involved are simultaneously diagonalizable. For problems where this is not the case, we describe an approach to compute optimal or near-optimal regularization parameters by using operator approximations for the original problem. Several tests are performed for 1D and 2D examples using different norms on the errors, showing the effectiveness of this approach.},

@article{R.D.Pascual-Marqui.1999,
abstract = {This paper reviews the class of instantaneous, 3D, discrete, linear solutions for the EEG inverse problem. Five different inverse methods are analyzed and compared: minimum norm, weighted minimum norm, Backus and Gilbert, weighted resolution optimization (WROP), and low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). The inverse methods are compared by testing localization errors in the estimation of single and multiple sources. These tests constitute the minimum necessary condition to be satisfied by any tomography. Of the five inverse solutions tested, only LORETA demonstrates the ability of correct localization in 3D space. The other four inverse solutions should not be used if the research aim is to localize the neuronal generators of EEG in a 3D brain. In this sense, minimum norm, weighted minimum norm, Backus and Gilbert, and WROP can be likened to x-rays, where depth information is totally lacking. For the sake of reproducible research, all the material and methods used in this part of the study, consisting of computer programs (source code and executables) and data, are available upon request to the author. In this way, all the results and conclusions can be checked, reproduced, and validated by the interested reader.},

abstract = {Book Description Other volumes in the Wiley Series in Probability and Mathematical Statistics Abstract Inference UIf Grenander The traditional setting of statistical inference is when both sample space and parameter space are finite dimensional Euclidean spaces or subjects of such spaces. During the last decades, however, a theory has been developed that allows the sample space to be some abstract space. More recently, mathematical techniquesespecially the method of sieveshave been constructed to enable inferences to be made in abstract parameter spaces. This work began with the authors 1950 monograph on inference in stochastic processes (for general sample space) and with the sieve methodology (for general parameter space) that the author and his co-workers at Brown University developed in the 1970s. Both of these cases are studied in this volume, which is the first comprehensive treatment of the subject. 1980 Order Statistics, 2nd Ed. Herbert A. David Presents up-to-date coverage of the theory and applications of ordered random variables and their functions. Develops the distribution theory of order statistics systematically, and treats short-cut methods, robust estimation, life testing, reliability, and extreme-value theory. Applications include procedures for the treatment of outliers and other data analysis techniques. Provides extensive references to the literature and the tables contained therein. Exercises included. 1980 Theory and Applications of Stochastic Differential Equations Zeev Schuss Presents SDE theory through its applications in the physical sciences, e.g., the description of chemical reactions, solid state diffusion and electrical conductivity, population genetics, filtering problems in communication theory, etc. Introduces the stochastic calculus in a simple way, presupposing only basic analysis and probability theory. Shows the role of first passage times and exit distributions in modeling physical phenomena. Introduces analytical methods in order to obtain information on probabilistic quantities such as moments and distribution of first passage times and transition probabilities, and demonstrates the role of partial differential equations. Methods include singular perturbation techniques, old and new asymptotic methods, and boundary layer theory. 1980 Download Description The first systematic, book-length treatment of the subject. Begins with a general introduction and the formal mathematical background behind qualitative and quantitative robustness. Stresses concepts. Provides selected numerical algorithms for computing robust estimates, as well as convergence proofs. Tables contain quantitative robustness information for a variety of estimates.},
